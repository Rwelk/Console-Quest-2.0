 Hey there, game creator Jeffrey here.

 I just wanted to give some quick instructions before starting the game.
 There are a few libraries outside of the standard python library that you'll need to run the game.
 They are numpy, pillow, and pygame.
 
 Just do a quick 'pip install _______' in your command prompt of choice for all of them, and you'll be good to go.
 So like, 
 'pip install numpy',
 'pip install pillow', and
 'pip install pygame', without the quotes.
 
 I also judiciously use the graphics.py file, created by John Zelle.
 It was created for the book “Python Programming: An Introduction to Computer Science” as a wrapper for tkinter.
 Documentation can be found at:

 You don't have to do anything special about it; the file's already in the folder.
 I just wanted to acknowledge its existence, and thank him for letting me use it.
 
 For that matter, I want to thank my proffesors, Matthew Eicholtz, Christian Roberson, and Johnathan Cazalas.
 All three of them were instrumental in my growth as a programmer, and I can't thank them enough for all the help.

 Anyways, I've talked you ear off long enough.
 I hope you have a fun time playing my game.
 Oh, and the recommended level for fighting the orc is ~15.
